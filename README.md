# Mobile-Robot-Equipped-with-GNSS-Based-Remote-Steering-and-Variable-Wheels
A GNSS-based all-terrain robot integrating a four-bar linkage variable wheel and four-wheel steering system. It enables remote control via RTK-GNSS for precise localization, adapting wheel geometry for climbing, rough surfaces, and stable movement across diverse terrains.
