## Usage Notes

- All files are read-only documents; source materials are stored in their respective directories (`cad/`, `arduino/`, `ros2/`, etc.).  
- When referencing documentation in external reports, cite the filename and version (e.g., “논문.hwp, Rev. 2.1”).  
- For English abstracts or summaries, refer to the main project `README.md`.  
- Conversion to `.pdf` format is recommended for public submissions or archiving.

## Revision Policy

- Each document represents a distinct stage of the project:  
  - **Design** → Hardware layout and system architecture  
  - **Development** → Firmware, control, and network implementation  
  - **Evaluation** → Experimental results and analysis  
  - **Publication** → Paper, poster, and presentation formats
