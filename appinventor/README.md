# ?벑 App Inventor ??GNSS Remote Steering Controller

This folder contains the **App Inventor project (.aia)** used to remotely control  
the all-terrain robot equipped with GNSS-based steering and variable wheels.  
The app provides an intuitive interface for driving, mode switching, and map-based tracking.

---

## ?㎛ Overview

The App Inventor project (`joystick.aia`) was developed to send **TCP/IP control commands**  
to the Flask server, which relays them to the **ESP32 ??STM32 ??motor system**.

It integrates:
- **Real-time GNSS map visualization**
- **Joystick-style remote control (Forward / Stop / Back)**
- **Wheel mode switching (CW / NORMAL / CCW)**
- **Steering angle slider control**
- **Embedded live video streaming via Flask web server**

**UI Elements:**

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| ?쎇截?*GNSS ?꾩튂 吏?? | Displays real-time robot position from Flask `/position` API |
| ?렏 *Live Video* | Streams camera feed via Flask URL (`http://192.168.137.208`) |
| ?빘截?*Control Buttons* | Forward / Stop / Back control (TCP commands) |
| ?숋툘 *Wheel Mode* | Switch between terrain modes (CCW, NORMAL, CW) |
| ?봽 *Steering Slider* | Adjusts steering value between 0째 and 270째 |

## ?? How to Use

1. Open **MIT App Inventor** ??*Import project (.aia)* ??select `joystick.aia`
2. Edit IP field (`http://192.168.137.208`) to match your Flask server address
3. Connect your Android device via **AI2 Companion** or build `.apk`
4. Start the Flask server (`server/app.py`)
5. Tap **Front / Stop / Back** to move the robot, or adjust steering and wheel mode
6. View GNSS map updates and live video feed in real time

## ?쭬 Design Notes

- The app UI was optimized for **7~10 inch tablets**
- The GNSS map uses a **web-view** component linked to Flask `/map` route
- The steering slider outputs an integer value (0??70), normalized for servo PWM
- Each mode button triggers a distinct packet for **STM32 mode switching logic**
